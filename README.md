Hello, I’m @Siliconize.

I’m passionate about understanding the low-level fundamentals of computer networking, 
computer science, electrical engineering, math, and physics. My goal is to learn as much as possible about
the core principles that drive these fields and apply that knowledge to solve complex, technical challenges.
